    <p>On this page we present the setting and results of our experiments.</p>

    <div class="row"><br>

      <h2>Experimental Setup</h2>
      <p>We compute the transfer pattern database for the original
  transit network created for one service day. To evaluate the effect of delay
  on the correctness of transfer patterns routing, we modify the original trips
  according to the selected scenario. We run transfer pattern shortest path
  queries with the original transfer patterns using direct connection data
  stemming from the modified GTFS data. The result of that query is compared to
  the result of a Dijkstra on the modified network. For each dataset and each
  scenario, including the original network, we run 15,000 random
  queries.</p>
      <p>To reduce the precomputation time of the transfer patterns, we limit
  the search from each stop to three transfers maximum. As a result of
  this, hub-based transfer pattern queries may find paths with up to six transfers.</p>
  <p>In times of low transit activity, e.g.
  during the night, many routes require more transfers than in regular periods.
  Due to the three-transfers-restriction the reference Dijkstra cannot find a
  suitable shortest path, although it often searches the whole network. In
  order to reduce the number of empty query responses and thereby reducing the
  time needed to conduct the experiments, we restricted the query time between 6am
  and 6pm. Depending on the dataset, we can still compare about 13,000
  of the 15,000 performed queries.</p>
    </div><br>
    <div class="span6">
      <h2>Test Networks</h2>
      <p>All tests are performed on two data sets: Toronto and New
  York City. Toronto, which stems from a single <a href="http://www.toronto.ca/open)">GTFS feed</a>, has a
  network of <em>10,883 stops</em>, <em>40,651 trips</em>, <em>4,498,284 nodes</em> and <em>7,434,641 arcs</em>. The <a href="http://www.mta.info/developers">New York City data set</a>
  comprises the GTFS feeds of the subway, the bus networks for all five
  boroughs and the NYC bus company&rsquo;s data, set and has <em>16,765 stops</em>, <em>61,474
  trips</em>, <em>6,880,107 nodes</em> and <em>11,372,629 arcs</em> for a single day. Note that the GTFS data needs some preprocessing (sorting, replace special characters etc.) to be understood by our parser. The actual data we used to conduct the experiments can be found in the <a href="code.html">code section</a>.</p>
      <p>For each dataset we test 7 different scenarios. The first
  represents the <code><em>Original</em></code> transit network of a given data set without any
  delays. The first three scenarios are described by a single delay function
  used to update 25% of the trips respectively. They differ in the amount of
  delay, applying <code><em>Low</em></code> (scenario 1), <code><em>Medium</em></code> (scenario 2) and <code><em>High</em></code> (scenario 3)
  delay.</p>
      <p>The remaining three scenarios are a
  combination of delay functions. Scenario 4 represents a good working transit
  network with a small percentage of trips with little delay (10% with 5
  minutes, 3% with 15 minutes, 1% with 50 minutes). Scenario 5 delays 20 per
  cent of all trips for 5 minutes, 10 per cent for 15 minutes and 5 per cent
  for 50 minutes. The last scenario induces a delay for all trips in the
  network. 40% of all trips are delayed with <code><em>Low</em></code>, 40% <code><em>Medium</em></code>  and 20% with <code><em>High</em></code>. We call the latter
  scenarios <code><em>&quot;Switzerland&quot;</em></code>, <code><em>&quot;Germany&quot;</em></code>, and <code><em>&quot;India&quot;</em></code>.</p>

      <h2>Evaluation</h2>
      <p>For each query we compare the result of the Dijkstra
  search with the result of the transfer pattern search. If for each path found
  by the Dijkstra search there is a path of equal costs found by the transfer
  patterns search, the query is classified as <strong>Equal</strong>. If this criteria fails for
  a query, but the costs of the corresponding paths differ at most by 20% and the penalties
  differ at most by 1, the
  query is classified as <strong>Almost Equal</strong>. In all other cases, if there is at least
  one optimal path which has no matching transfer pattern path, the queries
  are classified as <strong>Failing</strong>.</p>
    <p>In a first set of experiments we limited the paths to 3 transfers (not listed here, results are a subset of the presented experiments). In the second series we did not limit the number of transfers. To force the Dijkstra to similar routes as Transfer Pattern Routing, we initially limit the Dijkstra to 3 transfers and lift this restriction for paths that transfer at a hub. In the seconds setting, the structure of the query graph allows for paths with more than 3 transfers without traversing a hub. Refer to the <a href="implementation.html#query_graph">implementation of the query graph</a> for further information. This leads to query responses where Transfer Pattern Routing finds a hub-free path with cost A, while the path found by the Dijkstra transfers at a hubs and has cost B (with A &lt; B). In the second series of experiments we have the additional class <strong>Long paths without hub</strong> for such queries.</p>

      <h2>Analysis</h2>
      <p>The scenarios can be subdivided in three groups: The
  baseline with the <code><em>Original</em></code> scenario, scenarios 1 - 3 as
  <em>artificial</em> scenarios with only one delay function and the
  scenarios 4 - 6 as <em>real-world</em> scenarios with combinations of different
  delay functions.</p>
  
      <p>To explain the remaining share of non-equal
  queries for the baseline, we refer to the <a href="implementation.html#problems">discussion of
  problems</a> our implementation still has.</p>
  
        <p>We start our analysis of the results examining the
  relationship between the individual scenarios within each group. For the NYC
  dataset the percentage of queries
  classified as <strong>Equal</strong> decreases with more delay, whereas the percentages of
  queries classified as <strong>Failing</strong> increases. The same aspect can
  be found for the <em>real-world</em> scenario group and the NYC dataset. The queries classified as <strong>Almost Equal</strong> behave quite similar, except for the experiments on New York City with unlimited transfers. In this setting there is a minor shift from <strong>Almost Equal</strong> to <strong>Equal</strong> for the first scenarios.</p>
  
  <p>For the Toronto dataset the percentage of <strong>Failing</strong> and <strong>Almost Equal</strong> queries in the <em>real-world</em> group show a more or less ascending
  order. The same results can be observed for New York City. For both data sets the third scenario of both groups
  exhibit the smallest share of <strong>Equal</strong> queries and the largest percentage of <strong>Almost Equal</strong> 
  and <strong>Failing</strong> queries. As expected, delay has an observeable influence to the quality of the routing results.</p>
  
       <p>In general, the results show that with increasing average
       amount of delay the percentage of <strong>Equal</strong> queries decreases only slightly. For queries which
       lose their status as <strong>Equal</strong>, the transfer pattern search in some cases
  found alternative routes with acceptable costs classified as <strong>Almost Equal</strong>. The share of this class of queries rises compared to the baseline by at most 3.0% for Toronto and by 1.18% for New York City. There is the tendency of an increasing amount of <strong>Long paths without hub</strong>.
  Just in a few cases the search fails due to a lack of alternative transfer patterns and the query is
  classified as <strong>Failing</strong>. The differences between the share of <strong>Failing</strong> in the baseline and in the worst scenarios is not big enough to speak of a pejoration: There are 0.67% more failings queries for Toronto, and 0.72% for NYC.</p>

    <p>Comparing the values of both data sets to each other it
    becomes obvious that the quality of the queries for Toronto is better than for
    New York City, generally having more queries classified as <strong>Equal</strong> and less as <strong>Almost Equal</strong> or <strong>Failing</strong>.
    This may be caused by the size and structure of the transit network, allowing for longer travels with more transfers in New York. As the delay increases, the percentage of <strong>Equal</strong> falls faster for Toronto (share is 4.87% smaller in the worst scenario) than for New York City (2.96% decrease compared to baseline). For the latter, there are even two scenarios where the share of such queries slightly increases. We may infer from these observations that the robustness of Transfer Pattern Routing towards real-time updates depends on the structure of the underlying transit network.</p>
